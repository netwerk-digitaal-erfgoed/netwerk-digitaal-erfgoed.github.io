The Network of Terms has been expanded with four new thesauri. These sources provide concepts for describing and linking heritage information across different domains.

The Network of Terms brings together terms and concepts from multiple sources. With the addition of these four thesauri, the thematic coverage increases and it becomes easier to use regional, thematic, and historical concepts in relation to one another.

## Thesaurus Kamp Westerbork

The thesaurus of Kamp Westerbork describes concepts related to the history of Kamp Westerbork.  
The source contains terms for places, events, and organisations in the context of persecution, deportation, and remembrance in the period 1933–1945.

## Vrouwenthesaurus van Atria

The Vrouwenthesaurus was developed by Atria.  
The thesaurus contains terms about women, gender, emancipation, and feminism and defines relationships between synonyms and broader, narrower, and related terms.

The terms describe topics connected to the position and lived experience of women in society, such as economic independence, domestic violence, informal care, migration, political participation, and stereotyping. Historical topics are also included, such as the first feminist wave, women’s suffrage, witch persecutions, and Black women’s history.

In addition, the thesaurus includes concepts from women’s studies and feminist theory, such as intersectionality, theories of power, the nature–culture debate, and queer theory. Terms relating to men and masculinity are also part of the thesaurus.

## Regiotermen Fryslân

Regiotermen Fryslân is a regional thesaurus for Frisian heritage.  
The source mainly contains persons who are locally or regionally significant and who are often absent from national or international thesauri.

The terms are managed and moderated at the regional level and are provided with persistent identifiers. This makes it possible to link region-specific persons unambiguously to collections.

## Canon van Limburg

The Canon van Limburg consists of fifty windows on the history of Limburg. The associated thesaurus describes events, persons, places, and developments in the history of Limburg, from prehistory to the present, based on current scholarly insights.

## Coherence in the Network of Terms

With these four additions, coherence within the Network of Terms is strengthened.

- Regional and thematic concepts are explicitly available.
- Linking between sources across different domains becomes easier.
- Reuse of terms in collection management and descriptions is better supported.

In this way, the Network of Terms continues to develop as an infrastructure for shared and reusable terminology in the digital heritage domain.
