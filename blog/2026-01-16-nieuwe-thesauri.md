The Network of Terms has been expanded with four new thesauri. These sources provide access to knowledge about heritage, history, regional topics and social themes, and supply concepts for describing and linking heritage information.

The Network of Terms brings together terms and concepts from various sources. With the addition of these four thesauri, subject coverage increases and it becomes easier to use regional, thematic and historical concepts in relation to each other.

## Westerbork Camp Thesaurus

The [Westerbork Camp](https://data.kampwesterbork.nl/thesaurus) thesaurus describes concepts related to the history of Westerbork Camp.
The source contains terms for places, events and organisations in the context of persecution, deportation and remembrance during the period 1933–1945.

## Women's Thesaurus by Atria

The [Women's Thesaurus](https://collectie.atria.nl/thesaurus) was developed by Atria.
The thesaurus contains terms about women, gender, emancipation and feminism, and establishes relationships between synonyms, broader, narrower and related concepts.

The terms describe subjects related to the position and lived experiences of women in society, such as economic independence, domestic violence, informal care, migration, political participation and stereotyping. Historical themes are also included, such as the first wave of feminism, women's suffrage, witch trials and Black women's history.

Additionally, the thesaurus contains concepts from women's studies and feminist theory, such as intersectionality, theories of power, the nature-culture debate and queer theory. Terms about men and masculinity are also part of the thesaurus.

## Regional Terms Fryslân

[Regional Terms Fryslân](https://fryslan.regiotermen.nl) is a regional thesaurus for Frisian heritage.
The source primarily contains persons who are of local or regional significance and are often absent from national or international thesauri.

The terms are regionally managed and moderated and are provided with persistent identifiers. This allows regionally specific persons to be unambiguously linked to collections.

## Canon of Limburg

The [Canon of Limburg](https://www.canonvannederland.nl/nl/limburg/limburg-nieuw) consists of fifty windows on the history of Limburg. The accompanying thesaurus describes events, persons, places and developments, from prehistory to the present, based on current scholarly insights.

## Coherence in the Network of Terms

With these four additions, the coherence within the Network of Terms is strengthened:

- regional and thematic concepts are explicitly available.
- connections between sources across different domains become easier.
- reuse of terms in collection management and descriptions is better supported.

The Network of Terms thus continues to develop as an infrastructure for shared and reusable terminology within digital heritage.
