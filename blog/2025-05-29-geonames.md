The [Network of Terms](/services/network-of-terms/) now includes GeoNames places from all over the world.

<!-- truncate -->

The Network of Terms already had a terminology source for geographical names in The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.
NDE has now added a separate [terminology source](https://termennetwerk.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/en/sources) with worldwide place names.

GeoNames does not offer a SPARQL endpoint, so NDE provides its own.
Both terminology sources run on the same Fuseki instance, with SPARQL queries filtering by country.
The SPARQL endpoint is fed data from an [updated pipeline](https://github.com/netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed/geonames-rdf)
that downloads a full GeoNames data dump and converts it to RDF using [SPARQL Anything](https://github.com/SPARQL-Anything/sparql.anything).

NDE also publishes the output of this pipeline as a periodically updated RDF dump at https://geonames.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/geonames.zip.
