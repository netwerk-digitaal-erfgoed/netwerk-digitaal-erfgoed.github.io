title: Is it http://schema.org or https://schema.org?

If you work with linked data, you’ve probably noticed something confusing: sometimes schema.org appears with **http**, sometimes with **https**. Which one is correct — and why do tools favor the one over the other and does this mean extra work for NDE services?

## What is schema.org?

**Schema.org** is a shared vocabulary used to describe structured data on the web. It defines types like `CreativeWork`, `Person`, `Organization`, and thousands more, allowing machines — search engines, crawlers, knowledge graphs, and validation tools — to understand content in a standardized way via classes and properties.

Historically, schema.org identifiers were defined using `http://schema.org/`

Later, the *website* itself adopted HTTPS. That means you’ll now see both http://schema.org/ and https://schema.org/ used in markup. But, webpages are not the same as identifiers! And while your webbrowser just "ends up" at https://schema.org/ for a lot of tools (including SPARQL endpoint) identifiers starting with http://schema.org/ and **not the same** as those starting with https://schema.org/.

## JSON-LD Contexts and Remote Document Retrieval

When you write JSON-LD - one of the representation of linked data - like this:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "CreativeWork"
}
```

JSON-LD processors (like riot, shacl validate, ...) follow a standardized mechanism called [Remote Document and Context Retrieval](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/#remote-document-and-context-retrieval):

1. The processor sees `@context: "https://schema.org"`.
2. It resolves that context URL.
3. The schema.org context ultimately maps to https://schema.org/docs/jsonldcontext.json

Inside that document you’ll find something important:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://schema.org/"
  }
}
```

This line tells the JSON-LD processor: all terms without prefixes belong to the `http://schema.org/` vocabulary. So even if your markup uses `https://schema.org`, the context defines the **canonical vocabulary base** as HTTP.

## Why Tools Resolve HTTPS Terms to HTTP

Because the context explicitly sets `@vocab: "http://schema.org/"` a JSON-LD processor expands data like `"@type": "CreativeWork"` to `"http://schema.org/CreativeWork"`.

Another example you can try on the commandline:
```
echo '{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"CreativeWork","name":"Example"}' | riot --syntax=jsonld --output=nquads
_:B340f47fa8c03ab6abd37b1f9351ee068 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://schema.org/CreativeWork> .
_:B340f47fa8c03ab6abd37b1f9351ee068 <http://schema.org/name> "Example" .
```
This is why tools — including structured-data validators, knowledge-graph pipelines, or libraries like Riot — often normalize everything to HTTP IRIs.
They aren’t downgrading security, they’re following the vocabulary definition from the official context.


## Are you using the wrong identifiers?

Short answer: **No — both usually work (albeit that making tools understand both takes some effort!!).**

But when you're making requirements or application profiles, it's better to use `http://schema.org/`.

Do expect tools to resolve terms to `http://schema.org/` because the official JSON-LD context defines the vocabulary that way.
