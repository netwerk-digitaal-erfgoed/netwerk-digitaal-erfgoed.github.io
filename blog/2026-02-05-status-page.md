We launched a [public status page](https://status.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl) to provide real-time insight into the availability of NDE services.

## Transparency

Because [NDE services](/services/) are fundamental building blocks in the digital heritage network,
it is important that you can rely on their being available. 

While we do our best to prevent service disruptions, we want to be open about if and when those happen.
That’s why we’ve launched a status page that shows the current state of each service and provides historical uptime data
for the past 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days.

## Stay informed
