# Introduction

The Dutch [Digital Heritage Network](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/en/nl) (NDE) makes cultural heritage accessible to all.

It is a collaboration between heritage institutions, both large and small. NDE:

* publishes [Requirements](requirements.md) and best practices that improve interoperability   
* offers [Services](services/index.md) that help you manage, use and share heritage data.

## Getting Started

This is the central NDE documentation site. 
It brings together information from various sources, pointing back to those sources for more details. 

The documentation approaches the heritage network from three perspectives:

* [Users of heritage data](use/index.md)
* [Managers of heritage data](publish/index.md)
* [Software developers](build/index.md).

Youâ€™ll also find a [Glossary](glossary.md) where relevant concepts are explained.
