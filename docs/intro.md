# Introduction

The Dutch [Digital Heritage Network](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/en/nl) (NDE) makes cultural heritage accessible to all.

It is a collaboration between heritage institutions, both large and small. NDE:

* publishes [Requirements](requirements.md) and best practices that improve interoperability   
* offers [Services](services/index.md) that help you to manage, use and share heritage data.
* ... (TODO)


## Getting Started

* If you’re a **user of heritage data**, start with <a href="/use">Use datasets</a>.
* If you’re a **collection manager**, you may want to start with [Manage data](manage/index.md).
* If you’re a **software developer**, start with [Build software](build/index.md).
