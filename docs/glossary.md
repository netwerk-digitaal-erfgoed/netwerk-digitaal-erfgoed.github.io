# Glossary

## Collection Management System

TODO

## Data Platform

A software application that publishes datasets. 

It can be integrated in a [Collection Management System](#collection-management-system) or be a separate system.

Data owners are responsible for Data Platforms.

## Dataset Description

An RDF document that documents a dataset. Formally defined in the [Requirements for Datasets](https://netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed.github.io/requirements-datasets/).

## Data model

Can be generic or domain-specific.

## Persistent HTTP URI

A URI that is resolvable over HTTP(S) and once available must remain to be accessible. 

May contain a PID.

## Service Platform

A software application with the purpose of making data from one or several [Data Platforms](#data-platform)
available for a specific purpose, for example through a website or app.

Examples are:

- making heritage objects from the Dutch colonial past available for heritage research;
- keeping the memory of World War II alive by presenting stories about it.

Service Platforms are the responsibility of the Service Providers.

## Term

A word, name, acronym, phrase or other symbol with a formal definition, published in the [Network of Terms](/services/network-of-terms/index.md).

Terms describe what heritage is about. Terms are, for example, subjects, persons or places. For example the Night watch: it is a 'painting', made by 'Rembrandt' in 'Amsterdam'.

Yet a term is more than a word. Each term has an identifier, a so-called URI. A URI is a unique address which makes it unambiguously clear which term is meant. For example, the (Dutch) term 'noodweer' could be a legal concept or really bad weather? The meaning becomes clear when you read the URI of the term, such as http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q741507.

In addition, a term can contain additional information, such as a definition or an alternative name. For example the term "painting" with the URI http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300177435. The extra information about this term makes it clear that it has a synonym (in Dutch), 'schilderstuk'.
