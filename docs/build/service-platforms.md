# Service Platforms

[Service Platforms](/glossary.md#service-platform) usually need to find and transform datasets.

## Find datasets

To have a quick look at datasets available, you can use the [Dataset Register website](https://datasetregister.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/?lang=en).

For automation, developers will want to use the [Dataset Register SPARQL endpoint](/services/dataset-register/sparql.md).


## Transform data

Service Platforms may need to [transform](../use/transform.md) source data to make it usable in the Platform and its UIs.
